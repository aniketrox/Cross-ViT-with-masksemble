## Abstract

In this work, we investigate a Masksemble-aided Cross ViT model to measure the uncertainty of feature representations for cancer identification. We propose a Cross ViT with a special Masksemble Block in order to create discriminative image features. The Masksemble layer estimates the uncertainty of a given dermatoscopy image that plays a crucial role in cancer identification, and then it is passed to the Cross ViT network for the classification task. The comprehensive results show that our method outperforms CNN models and vision transformers. The model will detect skin cancer by differentiating the cancerous cells (malignant) from the non-cancerous ones (benign). The prediction of the model is measured by performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and average accuracy along with class-wise accuracy, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition to being verified for binary classification, the suggested model is also tested for many classes using the HAM-10000 dataset, demonstrating the system's effectiveness in multiple-classification scenarios.
